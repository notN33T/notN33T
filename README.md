# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Software engineer (At least that's what I'm telling myself).<br>
In my spare time I develop various software with the hope of solving some people's problems.<br>
There aren't many projects here, but this list is only going to grow ðŸ’ª

## My projects:

* [`Japanese keyboard`](https://japanese-keyboard.com) -  Allows you to use the Japanese keyboard with hiragana / katakana / kanji (autocomplete feature) online.


## Open source:

* [`rseed`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rseed?activeTab=readme) - The `npm` package for generating readable random data
